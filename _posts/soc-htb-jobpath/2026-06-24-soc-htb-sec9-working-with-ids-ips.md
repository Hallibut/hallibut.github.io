## **Introduction To IDS/IPS**

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** are critical components of a defense-in-depth network security strategy. While both utilize similar detection methods, their primary functions and network placements differ based on how they handle potential threats.

| **Feature** | **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Function** | Passively monitors traffic and sends alerts to a management station. | Actively intervenes and prevents detected threats. |
| **Action** | Does *not* stop or block intrusions. | Drops malicious packets, blocks traffic, and resets connections. |
| **Placement** | Behind the firewall (internal side) to monitor traffic that bypassed the perimeter. | Inline, directly behind the firewall, where it has the authority to block traffic. |

Both systems use two primary methods to balance threat detection and minimize false alarms:

- Identifies known threats **using previously established bad patterns** and **malware signatures**.
- Establishes a **baseline** of "normal" network behavior and **triggers actions for any deviations**. This is proactive against new threats but is more prone to false positives.

Deployment:

- **Network-based:** Typically placed behind the firewall to focus on internal traffic and threats that have made it past the first line of defense.
- **Host-based (HIDS/HIPS):** Can be implemented directly on individual host machines to monitor their specific inbound and outbound traffic.

Updates:

To maintain a strong defense, the systems require ongoing management and integration into broader security monitoring frameworks.

Because the threat landscape is constantly changing, security teams must proactively maintain these systems by:

- Regularly updating threat signatures to catch newly discovered malware.
- Continuously fine-tuning anomaly detection algorithms to ensure accuracy and reduce false positives.

**SIEM** systems act as the central hub for network security:

- **Log Aggregation:** They collect logs from IDS, IPS, and various other network devices.
- **Event Correlation:** By analyzing data from multiple sources, SIEMs can connect the dots between seemingly unrelated events to detect complex, coordinated attacks.
- **Unified Visibility:** This centralized approach gives security teams a complete picture of the network, enabling faster and more effective incident response.

## Suricata

### Suricata Fundamentals

**Suricata** is a highly efficient, open-source network security tool utilized for Intrusion Detection (IDS), Intrusion Prevention (IPS), and Network Security Monitoring (NSM).

- It is a community-led project managed by the non-profit *Open Information Security Foundation (OISF)*.
- It thoroughly inspects all network traffic, including deep dives into *individual application-layer transactions*, to detect malicious activity.
- Its effectiveness relies on a *sophisticated set of rules* that guild its analysis and identify potential threats.
- It is *exceptionally fast and optimized* to run at high speeds on both standard, off-the-shelf hardware and specialized equipment.

#### **Suricata Operation Modes**

Suricata operates in four (4) distinct modes:

| **Mode** | **Role / Stance** | **Action Taken** | **Key Advantages** | **Drawbacks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | Silent Observer | Passively examines traffic and flags potential attacks without intervening. | Augments network visibility and accelerates response times. | Offers no direct protection or active blocking. |
| **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** | Proactive / Inline | Scrutinizes all traffic and blocks attacks before they reach the internal network. | Proactively thwarts threats. | May introduce network latency; risks blocking legitimate traffic if rules aren't rigorously tested. |
| **Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS)** | Hybrid | Passively monitors traffic but actively transmits RST (reset) packets against abnormal activities. | Strikes a balance between active protection and maintaining low latency. | Requires careful tuning to ensure RST packets effectively disrupt the correct sessions. |
| **Network Security Monitoring (NSM)** | Dedicated Logger | Logs all encountered network information without performing active/passive analysis or prevention. | Provides a wealth of historical data for retrospective incident investigations. | Generates a very high volume of data to store and manage. |

#### **Suricata Inputs**

Inputs dictate how Suricata ingests network traffic for inspection. They are divided into two main categories: *Offline* and *Live*.

| **Category** | **Interface / Method** | **Description & Limitations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Offline** | **PCAP (LibPCAP)** | Processes previously captured packet files. Ideal for post-incident investigations and safely testing new rule configurations. |
| **Live** | **LibPCAP** | Reads packets directly from network interfaces in real-time.<br>**Limitation:** Suffers from performance constraints and lacks load-balancing. |
| **Live** | **NFQ (Netfilter Queue)** | A *Linux-specific inline IPS mode* working with `IPTables` to route packets from the kernel for inspection.<br>**Requirement:** Needs active "drop rules" to block malicious packets. |
| **Live** | **AF_PACKET** | A high-performance, multi-threaded *alternative* to LibPCAP.<br>**Limitation:** *Incompatible with older Linux distributions* and *cannot be used inline* *if the host machine also routes packets*. |

#### **Suricata Outputs**

Suricata generates various *logs, alerts, and network metadata* (like DNS requests and network flows). The two most notable formats are:

- **EVE (JSON):** The most critical output format. It acts as a comprehensive, JSON-formatted log that **records alerts, drops, and detailed metadata** (HTTP, DNS, TLS, flows). *Because it is JSON, it is easily ingested and analyzed by platforms like Logstash.*
- **Unified2:** A legacy, Snort-compatible binary alert format. It is primarily used to integrate with other software that relies on Snort's ecosystem and can be read using Snort’s `u2spewfoo` tool.

#### **Configuring Suricata & Custom Rules**

we can get an overview of all the rule files by listing `/etc/suricata/rules/`:

```bash
$ ls -lah /etc/suricata/rules/
total 27M
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jun 28 12:10 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Jul  4 14:44 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  31K Jun 27 20:55 3coresec.rules
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.9K Jun 15 05:51 app-layer-events.rules
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.1K Jun 27 20:55 botcc.portgrouped.rules

```

Each rule usually involves specific variables, such as `$HOME_NET` and `$EXTERNAL_NET` 

The rule examines traffic from the IP addresses specified in the `$HOME_NET` variable heading towards the IP addresses in the `$EXTERNAL_NET` variable.

```bash
$ pwd
/etc/suricata
$ ls
classification.config  reference.config  suricata.log
eve.json	      rules		**suricata.yaml**
fast.log	      stats.log	threshold.config
```

**These variables can be defined in the `suricata.yaml` configuration file.**

```bash
$ more /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
%YAML 1.1
---

```

To configure Suricata to load a custom rules file we would use a text editor to edit `.yaml` file as follow:

```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

- Add `/home/htb-student/local.rules` to **rule-files:** section in `suricata.yaml`
- Press the `Esc` key
- Enter `:wq` and then, press the `Enter` key

#### **Hands-on With Suricata Inputs**

With Suricata inputs, we can experiment with both *offline* and *live* input:

##### #1. With offline input

To read network trafffic, we can use **`-r <path/to/file>`** switch

```bash
$ suricata -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/suspicious.pcap
18/6/2026 -- 05:14:55 - <Notice> - This is Suricata version 6.0.13 RELEASE running in USER mode
18/6/2026 -- 05:14:55 - <Notice> - all 3 packet processing threads, 4 management threads initialized, engine started.
18/6/2026 -- 05:14:55 - <Notice> - Signal Received.  Stopping engine.
18/6/2026 -- 05:14:55 - <Notice> - Pcap-file module read 1 files, 5172 packets, 3941260 bytes
```

Suricata will create various logs (mainly `eve.json`, `fast.log`, and `stats.log`).

```bash
$ ls /var/log/suricata/
certs  core  eve.json  fast.log  files	old_eve.json  old_fast.log  old_stats.log  stats.log  suricata.log  suricata-start.log
```

To make the JSON easy to read, use `jq '.'`

```bash
cat eve.json | jq '.'
```

An alternative command can be executed to bypass checksums (`-k` flag) and log in a different directory (`-l` flag)

```bash
$ suricata -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/suspicious.pcap -k none -l .
5/7/2023 -- 13:37:43 - <Notice> - This is Suricata version 6.0.13 RELEASE running in USER mode
5/7/2023 -- 13:37:43 - <Notice> - all 3 packet processing threads, 4 management threads initialized, engine started.
5/7/2023 -- 13:37:43 - <Notice> - Signal Received.  Stopping engine.
5/7/2023 -- 13:37:43 - <Notice> - Pcap-file module read 1 files, 5172 packets, 3941260 bytes
```

**`-k none` (Checksum Validation):** This flag require Suricata to ture off packet **checksum.**

**`-l .` (Log Directory):** This flag establish a directory to export log file (`.` mean the current folder)

##### #2. With live input (IDS Mode)

We can try Suricata’s (Live) `LibPCAP` mode

- List out all network interfaces with `ifconfig`
- Select an interface you want to monitor
- Turn the monitor on `sudo suricata --pcap=<interface>`

```bash
$ sudo suricata --pcap=ens160 -vv
[sudo] password for htb-student:

5/7/2023 -- 13:44:01 - <Notice> - all 3 packet processing threads, 4 management threads initialized, engine started.

```

We can also use Suricata in `IDS` mode with `AF_PACKET` input

Both `sudo suricata -i ens160` and `sudo suricata --af-packet=ens160` perform the exact same function.

**AF_PACKET:** It is a native Linux kernel technology that allows for extremely fast, direct packet capturing with much lower CPU usage compared to the older `LibPCAP` library.

**The `-i` Flag's Role:** When run on Linux, `-i` automatically defaults to the superior `AF_PACKET` mode. You only need to explicitly use the `--pcap` flag if you specifically want to force Suricata to use the older `LibPCAP` method.

##### #3. For Suricata in Inline (`NFQ`) mode (IPS Mode)

First we need to establish this `iptables` command

```bash
$ sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0 
```

This mean all traffic **FORWARD** through this machine must not be forwarded directly; instead, it must be intercepted and sent to an **NFQUEUE (Netfilter Queue)** queue 0.

The second command is to enable **Suricata** to monitor this queue

```bash
$ sudo suricata -q 0
5/7/2023 -- 13:52:38 - <Notice> - This is Suricata version 6.0.13 RELEASE running in SYSTEM mode
5/7/2023 -- 13:52:39 - <Notice> - all 4 packet processing threads, 4 management threads initialized, engine started.
```

#### **Hands-on With Suricata Outputs**

`/var/log/suricata` directory is where Suricata save logs. Among these logs, we find the `eve.json`, `fast.log`, and `stats.log` files.

- **eve.json**: This file is Suricata's recommended output and contains JSON objects, each carrying diverse information. You cant use `jq 'select(**<something>**)'` to select specific things on the file.

```bash
$ cat /var/log/suricata/old_eve.json | jq 'select(.event_type == "alert")'
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-06T08:34:35.003163+0000",

- **fast.log**: This is a text-based log format that records alerts only and is enabled by default.

```bash
$ cat /var/log/suricata/old_fast.log
07/06/2023-08:34:35.003163  [**] [1:1:0] Known bad DNS lookup, possible Dridex infection [**] [Classification: (null)] [Priority: 3] {UDP} 10.9.24.101:51833 -> 10.9.24.1:53
```

- **stats.log**: This is a human-readable statistics log, which can be particularly useful while debugging Suricata deployments.

```bash
$ cat /var/log/suricata/old_stats.log

#### **Hands-on With Suricata Outputs - File Extraction**

Suricata has **[file extraction](https://docs.suricata.io/en/suricata-6.0.13/file-extraction/file-extraction.html)** feature allows us to capture and store files transferred.

First, tell Suricata how to handle extracted files by editing the `suricata.yaml` configuration file. Locate the `file-store` section and apply the following settings:

```bash
file-store:
  version: 2
  enabled: yes
  force-filestore: yes
```

In the same `file-store` section, we define where Suricata stores the extracted files. We set the `dir` option to the directory of our choice (I’m let it be default).

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec9-working-with-ids-ips/image%202.png)

File extraction does not happen automatically. You must give Suricata explicit instructions by writing a rule. (rule for only filestore).

```bash
alert http any any -> any any (msg:"FILE store all"; **filestore**; sid:2; rev:1;)
```

When the file is being extracted, it will be saved in a hash-based directory structure, you can . You can list all of them by using:

```bash
$ sudo find <folder_name> -type f 
<folder_name>/fb/fb20d18d00c806deafe14859052072aecfb9f46be6210acfce80289740f2e20e

```

And then using `xxd` to peak inside the file:

```bash
$ sudo xxd <folder_name>/21/21742fc621f83041db2e47b0899f5aea6caa00a4b67dbff0aae823e6817c5433 | head

```

In this case, the file was a *Windows executable* based on the file's header. More about the MS-DOS EXE format can be found in following resource [MZ](https://wiki.osdev.org/MZ).

#### **Live Rule Reloading Feature & Updating Suricata Rulesets**

Live rule reloading allows us to update our ruleset without interrupting ongoing traffic inspection.

In the `suricata.yaml` file, we should locate the `detect-engine` section and set the value of the `reload` parameter to `true`.

```bash
detect-engine:
  - reload: true
```

If is not there, just add it in.

#### **Validating Suricata's Configuration**

To validate the configuration, we can use the `-T` option provided by the Suricata command. This command runs a test to check if the configuration file is valid and all files referenced in the configuration are accessible.

```bash
$ sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
18/6/2026 -- 12:06:52 - <Info> - Running suricata under test mode
18/6/2026 -- 12:06:52 - <Notice> - This is Suricata version 6.0.13 RELEASE running in SYSTEM mode
18/6/2026 -- 12:06:53 - <Notice> - Configuration provided was successfully loaded. Exiting.
```

### Suricata Rule Development Part 1

#### **Suricata Rule Anatomy**

Here is a structure of Suricata rule

```bash
action protocol from_ip port -> to_ip port (msg:"Known malicious behavior, possible X malware infection"; content:"some thing"; content:"some other thing"; sid:10000001; rev:1;)
```

##### **#1 Core Rule Structure & Components**

| **Category** | **Component / Keyword** | **Description** | **Examples / Usage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Header** | **Action** | Instructs Suricata on what to do when a match occurs. | `alert`, `log`, `pass`, `drop`, `reject` |
|  | **Protocol** | The network protocol where the rule is evaluated. | `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, `ip`, `http`, `tls`, `dns` |
|  | **Directionality** | Arrows indicating the traffic flow between source and destination IPs/Ports. | `->` (One-way)<br>`<>` (Bidirectional) |
|  | **Ports** | The specific ports where traffic is evaluated. | `80`, `[8443,8080,!8443]`, `$UNCOMMON_PORTS` |
| **Message & Content** | **`msg`** | The human-readable alert message displayed to analysts. | `msg:"SSH connection attempt";` |
|  | **`flow`** | Identifies the originator/responder and monitors session states (e.g., "established"). | `flow:to_server, established;` |
|  | **`dsize`** | Matches based on the payload size (TCP segment length). | `dsize:>10000;` |
|  | **`content`** | The exact byte sequences or strings Suricata searches for in the payload. | `content:"image/gif";`<br>`content:" |
|  | **Rule Buffers** | Targets specific packet segments to save time/resources instead of searching everything. | `http.accept;`, `http_method;`, `http_uri;` |
| **Rule Options** | **`nocase`** | Makes the preceding content match case-insensitive. | `content:"User-Agent"; nocase;` |
|  | **`offset`** | Defines the exact starting byte position for a content match within the payload. | `offset:0; depth:5;` |
|  | **`distance`** | The minimum bytes to skip *after* a previous match before searching for the next. | `distance:10;` |
|  | **`within`** | The maximum byte window to search in *after* the `distance` anchor point. | `within:80;` |
| **Metadata** | **`sid`** | Signature ID; a unique numeric identifier for the rule. | `sid:10000001;` |
|  | **`rev`** | Revision number; tracks the evolution/version of the rule. | `rev:1;` |
|  | **`reference`** | Provides a link or trail back to the source information that inspired the rule. | `reference:url,example.com;` |

When you write a new rule yourself, you cannot just pick random `sid` numbers (like `sid:1` or `sid:2`) because they will conflict with existing system rules. The `sid` numbers are divided into the following ranges:

- **From 1 to 999,999:** The zone reserved exclusively for the default rules built into the Snort/Suricata software itself. (You should not use this range).
- **From 1,000,000 to 1,999,999:** The free zone dedicated to **Local rules** (custom/self-written rules). When creating a rule for your company or doing an exercise, you should start picking numbers from 1 million upwards (e.g., `sid:1000001;`).
- **From 2,000,000 and above:** The zone for professional Rule providers (such as Emerging Threats - ET, Abuse.ch). For example, the rule catching Dridex had the `sid` 2023476, just by seeing that it falls in the 2 million range, you instantly know it was downloaded from a well-known, professional repository.

##### **PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expression) Breakdown**

PCRE allows for advanced pattern matching using regular expressions. It should be enclosed in slashes (e.g., `/pattern/flags`) and should generally be used alongside `content` matches for performance.

**Example Pattern Analyzed:** `!"/^\$?[\sa-z\\_0-9.-]*(\&|$)/iRP"`

| **Character / Flag** | **Meaning in this Regex** |
| --- | --- |
| **`!`** | **Inverted match:** Triggers only when the pattern is *not* found. |
| **`/ ... /`** | The boundaries encasing the regular expression. |
| **`^`** | **Anchor:** Matches the start of the line/buffer. |
| **`\$?`** | Checks for an optional literal dollar sign (`$`) at the start. |
| **`[ ... ]*`** | Matches zero or more (`*`) of any characters defined inside the brackets. |
| **`\s`** | Matches a space character. |
| **`a-z`** | Matches any lowercase letter. |
| **`\\`** | Matches a literal backslash. |
| **`_0-9.-`** | Matches an underscore, any digit, a period, or a hyphen. |
| **`(\&|$)`** | Matches either a literal ampersand (`&`) **OR** (`|`) the end of the line (`$`). |
| **`i`** | **Flag:** Makes the regex case-insensitive. |
| **`R`** | **Flag:** Makes the match relative to the previous match. |
| **`P`** | **Flag:** Inspects the specific HTTP buffer requested (matches with rule buffers like `http_client_body`). |

#### **IDS/IPS Rule Development Approaches**

##### #1. Choosing Your Approach

- **Signature-based Detection:** You are looking for specific, known evidence of malware.
    - Highly precise for known threats, but bad at catching zero-days.
    - You use exact string matches like `content:"malicious_string";` or advanced regex with `pcre:"/regex/"`.
- **Anomaly/Behavior-based Detection:** You aren't looking for a specific file, but rather weird behavior (e.g., a massive data transfer or using a strange port).
    - Great for catching new, unknown threats, but generates more false positives.
    - You set *unusual ports* in the header (e.g., `> $HOME_NET $UNCOMMON_PORTS`) or use measurement keywords to detect *payload larger than usual* like `dsize:>10000;`.
- **Stateful Protocol Analysis:** You are checking if the connection behaves according to the rules of normal network traffic (baseline).
    - Tracks the state of the connection to identify unexpected deviations.
    - You use the `flow` keyword to **monitor session states**, such as `flow:established, to_server;` (only inspect traffic if a valid connection was already made).

##### #2. The Rule Structure

No matter which strategy you chose above, when it's time to write the rule, read it from left to right using this template:

> **[Action] [Protocol] [Src IP] [Port] -> [Dest IP] [Port] ( msg:"Description"; content:"Keyword"; [Position Modifiers]; sid:Number; rev:1; )**
> 
- **WHO & WHERE:** Who is traveling, where are they going, and how?
    - *Example:* `alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 80`
- **WHAT:** Name the alert so your analyst team knows immediately what happened.
    - *Example:* `msg:"Detected backdoor access attempt";`
- **WHAT TO FIND & HOW:** What exact evidence are you looking for, and where should Suricata look to save time?
    - *Example:* `content:"/login.php"; nocase; http_uri;` (Look for the text "/login.php", ignore capitalization, and only search inside the URL path).
- **WRITE IT DOWN:** Assign a tracking number.
    - *Example:* `sid:100001; rev:1;`

##### #3. Three Golden Rules for Writing

1. **Copy and Tweak:** Nobody writes a rule from a blank page. Always find an existing, working rule (like from Emerging Threats) that closely matches your goal. Copy it, then modify the IPs, Ports, and `content` fields to suit your needs.
2. **Limit the Scope for Performance:** If you force Suricata to blindly scan every byte of every packet, your network will slow down. Always pair your `content` matches with position modifiers like `http_uri`, `http_client_body`, or use `offset` (where to start looking) and `depth` (how far to look).
3. **Regex is a Last Resort:** PCRE uses a massive amount of CPU. Only use it when standard content matching fails (like finding randomized malware strings). If you *must* use regex, always put a fast, simple `content` match before the `pcre` statement so Suricata can filter out harmless traffic before doing the heavy lifting.

#### **Suricata Rule Development Example 1: Detecting PowerShell Empire**

The Suricata rule below is designed to detect possible outbound activity from [PowerShell Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire), a common post-exploitation framework used by attackers.

```bash
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"ET MALWARE Possible PowerShell Empire Activity Outbound"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; content:"/"; http_uri; depth:1; pcre:"/^(?:login\/process|admin\/get|news)\.php$/RU"; content:"session="; http_cookie; pcre:"/^(?:[A-Z0-9+/]{4})*(?:[A-Z0-9+/]{2}==|[A-Z0-9+/]{3}=|[A-Z0-9+/]{4})$/CRi"; content:"Mozilla|2f|5.0|20 28|Windows|20|NT|20|6.1"; http_user_agent; http_start; content:".php|20|HTTP|2f|1.1|0d 0a|Cookie|3a 20|session="; fast_pattern; http_header_names; content:!"Referer"; content:!"Cache"; content:!"Accept"; sid:2027512; rev:1;)
```

#### **Suricata Rule Development Example 2: Detecting Covenant**

```bash
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"detected by body"; content:"<title>Hello World!</title>"; detection_filter: track by_src, count 4 , seconds 10; priority:1; sid:3000011;)
```

**Rule source**: [Signature-based IDS for Encrypted C2 Traffic Detection - Eduardo Macedo](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/142718/2/572020.pdf)

The (inefficient) Suricata rule above is designed to detect certain variations of [Covenant](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant), another common post-exploitation framework used by attackers.

#### **Suricata Rule Development Example 3: Detecting Covenant (Using Analytics)**

```bash
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> any any (msg:"detected by size and counter"; dsize:312; detection_filter: track by_src, count 3 , seconds 10; priority:1; sid:3000001;)
```

This Suricata rule is designed to generate a high-priority alert if it detects at least three instances of TCP traffic within ten seconds that each contain a data payload of exactly 312 bytes, all originating from the same source IP within our network and headed anywhere.

#### **Suricata Rule Development Example 4: Detecting Sliver**

```bash
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Sliver C2 Implant Detected"; content:"POST"; pcre:"/\/(php|api|upload|actions|rest|v1|oauth2callback|authenticate|oauth2|oauth|auth|database|db|namespaces)(.*?)((login|signin|api|samples|rpc|index|admin|register|sign-up)\.php)\?[a-z_]{1,2}=[a-z0-9]{1,10}/i"; sid:1000007; rev:1;)
```

**Rule source**: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv19510951/](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv19510951/)

The Suricata rule above is designed to detect certain variations of [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver), yet another common post-exploitation framework used by attackers.

### Suricata Rule Development Part 2 (Encrypted Traffic)

By examining the plaintext details of SSL/TLS certificates, such as *the issuer* and *domain information*, security systems can identify anomalous or suspicious infrastructure. 

Additionally, utilizing **JA3 fingerprinting** creates *a unique hash from the client's initial handshake request*, allowing defenders to reliably identify and block specific malware families even when the actual payload is hidden.

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec9-working-with-ids-ips/image%203.png)

#### **Suricata Rule Development Example 5: Detecting Dridex (TLS Encrypted)**

```bash
alert tls $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET MALWARE ABUSE.CH SSL Blacklist Malicious SSL certificate detected (Dridex)"; flow:established,from_server; content:"|16|"; content:"|0b|"; within:8; byte_test:3,<,1200,0,relative; content:"|03 02 01 02 02 09 00|"; fast_pattern; content:"|30 09 06 03 55 04 06 13 02|"; distance:0; pcre:"/^[A-Z]{2}/R"; content:"|55 04 07|"; distance:0; content:"|55 04 0a|"; distance:0; pcre:"/^.{2}[A-Z][a-z]{3,}\s(?:[A-Z][a-z]{3,}\s)?(?:[A-Z](?:[A-Za-z]{0,4}?[A-Z]|(?:\.[A-Za-z]){1,3})|[A-Z]?[a-z]+|[a-z](?:\.[A-Za-z]){1,3})\.?[01]/Rs"; content:"|55 04 03|"; distance:0; byte_test:1,>,13,1,relative; content:!"www."; distance:2; within:4; pcre:"/^.{2}(?P<CN>(?:(?:\d?[A-Z]?|[A-Z]?\d?)(?:[a-z]{3,20}|[a-z]{3,6}[0-9_][a-z]{3,6})\.){0,2}?(?:\d?[A-Z]?|[A-Z]?\d?)[a-z]{3,}(?:[0-9_-][a-z]{3,})?\.(?!com|org|net|tv)[a-z]{2,9})[01].*?(?P=CN)[01]/Rs"; content:!"|2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 01|"; content:!"GoDaddy"; sid:2023476; rev:5;)
```

The rule above triggers an alert upon detecting a TLS session from the **external network** to the **home network**, where the payload of the session contains specific byte patterns and meets several conditions. These patterns and conditions correspond to SSL certificates that have been linked to certain variations of the **Dridex trojan**, as referenced by the SSL blacklist on `abuse.ch`

#### **Suricata Rule Development Example 6: Detecting Sliver (TLS Encrypted)**

```bash
alert tls any any -> any any (msg:"Sliver C2 SSL"; ja3.hash; content:"473cd7cb9faa642487833865d516e578"; sid:1002; rev:1;)
```

The Suricata rule above is designed to detect certain variations of [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) whenever it identifies a TLS connection with a specific JA3 hash.

The JA3 hash can be calculated by using `ja3` tool.

```bash
**$ ja3 -a --json /home/htb-student/pcaps/sliverenc.pcap**

## Snort

### Snort Fundamentals

Snort is an open-source tool, which serves as both an *Intrusion Detection System (IDS)* and *Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)*, but can also function as a *packet logger or sniffer*, akin to Suricata.

#### **Snort Operation Modes**

- Inline IDS/IPS (block traffic)
- Passive IDS (observe and detect traffic)
- Network-based IDS
- Host-based IDS (not ideally)

**`-r` (Read):** You hand Snort a `.pcap` file. Snort will watches and writes a report about anything shady it saw.

**`-i` (Interface):** You tell Snort to watch a live network cable (like `eth0`).

**`-Q` (Inline):** This flag tells Snort to actually **drop any bad packets.

**DAQ (Data Acquisition)** is the underlying technology that decides *how* Snort gets its hands on the network traffic.

**`afpacket`** is the name of a specific DAQ tool used in Linux. It acts like a special pair of gloves that allows Snort to directly grab, inspect, and drop live network packets as they arrive at the Linux network card.

#### **Snort Architecture**

| **Component** | **Function** | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Packet Sniffer (Packet Decoder)** | *Captures* network traffic and *recognizes the structure* of each packet. | Raw network packets from the network interface. | Decoded packets forwarded to the **Preprocessors**. |
| **Preprocessors** | Analyze packets to *identify their type, behavior, or anomalies before rule inspection*.<br>**Configured in `snort.lua`.** | Decoded packets from the Packet Sniffer. | Processed packet information forwarded to the **Detection Engine**. |
| **Detection Engine** | *Compares* packets against the *configured Snort ruleset* to determine whether suspicious activity is present. | Processed packet data from the Preprocessors. | Matching events forwarded to the **Logging and Alerting System**. |
| **Logging and Alerting System** | *Records events and generates alerts* according to the actions specified in Snort rules. | Events generated by the Detection Engine. | Log entries and security alerts. |
| **Output Modules** | Determine how and where logs and alerts are stored or transmitted.<br>**Configured in `snort.lua`.** | Alerts and log data from the Logging and Alerting System. | Output to `syslog`, `unified2 files`, `databases`, or other configured destinations. |

#### **Snort Configuration & Validating Snort's Configuration**

| **Section** | **Role in the Security Pipeline** |
| --- | --- |
| **Network Variables** | Defines your "Home" vs. "External" networks. |
| **Decoder Config** | Dictates how to deconstruct incoming raw packets (Ethernet, IP, TCP, etc.). |
| **Base Detection Engine** | Manages how Snort matches traffic patterns against the rule database. |
| **Dynamic Library Config** | Allows you to load modular plugins (shared objects) to add features without needing to recompile the whole Snort source code. |
| **Preprocessor Config** | Normalizes traffic (e.g., reassembling fragmented TCP streams or decoding HTTP) so the detection engine can understand the full context. |
| **Output Plugin Config** | Decides if alerts go to the console, a flat log file, or a database (like Elasticsearch or SQL). |
| **Rule Set Customization** | Tells Snort which specific sets of threat intelligence signatures to load and enforce. |
| **Decoder/Preprocessor Rules** | Specific rules for spotting malformed packets or evasion techniques used by attackers to sneak past the decoder. |
| **Shared Object Rules** | Advanced, pre-compiled rules that are often faster or allow for more complex detection logic than standard text-based rules. |
- **`snort_defaults.lua`**: Contains predefined paths (like where rules are stored) and standard variables. (Don't edit this file directly → leave it as your baseline.)
- **`snort.lua`**: You use this file to override the defaults and implement your specific security policy.

##### Pro-Tips

1. **Test Before You Run:** Never restart your production service without validating your config first. Use the `T` flag to check for syntax errors:
    
    `snort -c /path/to/snort.lua -T` 
    
    `-c` for configuration. 
    
    `-T` runs Snort in **test mode**
    
    *If it returns "Snort successfully validated the configuration," you are good to go.*
    
2. **Modularize:** If your configuration gets too large, you can create separate Lua files and use the `include` function in `snort.lua` to keep things organized.
3. **Start with the Network:** Always prioritize configuring your `HOME_NET` variable correctly. If Snort doesn't know what your network looks like, all the advanced detection rules will be much less effective.

```bash
**$ sudo more /root/snorty/etc/snort/snort.lua**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Snort++ configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- there are over 200 modules available to tune your policy.
-- many can be used with defaults w/o any explicit configuration.
-- use this conf as a template for your specific configuration.

-- 1. configure defaults
-- 2. configure inspection
-- 3. configure bindings
-- 4. configure performance
-- 5. configure detection
-- 6. configure filters
-- 7. configure outputs
-- 8. configure tweaks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. configure defaults
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- HOME_NET and EXTERNAL_NET must be set now
-- setup the network addresses you are protecting
HOME_NET = 'any'

-- set up the external network addresses.
-- (leave as "any" in most situations)
EXTERNAL_NET = 'any'

include 'snort_defaults.lua'

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. configure inspection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- mod = { } uses internal defaults
-- you can see them with snort --help-module mod

-- mod = default_mod uses external defaults
-- you can see them in snort_defaults.lua

-- the following are quite capable with defaults:

stream = { }
stream_ip = { }
stream_icmp = { }
stream_tcp = { }
stream_udp = { }
stream_user = { }
stream_file = { }
---SNIP---

```

In Snort 3, everything is a **module**. Whether it's a protocol analyzer (like `http_inspect`), a logger (like `alert_json`), or a detection inspector (like `arp_spoof`), they all follow the same pattern

- **Discovery:** Use `snort --help-modules` to see what is available in your build.

```bash
**$ snort --help-modules**
ack (ips_option): rule option to match on TCP ack numbers
active (basic): configure responses
address_space_selector (policy_selector): configure traffic processing based on address space
alert_csv (logger): output event in csv format
alert_fast (logger): output event with brief text format
alert_full (logger): output event with full packet dump
alert_json (logger): output event in json format
alert_syslog (logger): output event to syslog
alert_talos (logger): output event in Talos alert format
alert_unixsock (logger): output event over unix socket
alerts (basic): configure alerts
appid (inspector): application and service identification
appids (ips_option): detection option for application ids
arp (codec): support for address resolution protocol
arp_spoof (inspector): detect ARP attacks and anomalies
---SNIP---
```

- **Inspection:** Use `snort --help-config <module_name>` to see the specific parameters you can tune for that module.

```bash
**$ snort --help-config arp_spoof**
ip4 arp_spoof.hosts[].ip: host ip address
mac arp_spoof.hosts[].mac: host mac address
```

- **Implementation:** Define these modules in `snort.lua` using **Lua tables**.

To validating configuration files to Snort, use

```bash
**$ snort -c /root/snorty/etc/snort/snort.lua --daq-dir /usr/local/lib/daq**

**LibDAQ** is the "Data Acquisition Library." It is an abstraction layer that allows Snort to communicate with different network sources (hardware NICs, virtual bridges, or packet capture files).

`--daq-dir` told Snort where to identify the DAQ (Data Acquisition) modules installed on the system.

`-c` for configuration. 

#### **Snort Inputs**

Use `.pcap` file with `-r`: 

```bash
**$ sudo snort -c /root/snorty/etc/snort/snort.lua --daq-dir /usr/local/lib/daq -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/icmp.pcap**

#### **Snort Rules**

Snort rules, kinda like Suricata rules.

You can studying Snort rule writing from the following resources: [https://docs.snort.org/](https://docs.snort.org/), [https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rules/differences-from-snort.html](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rules/differences-from-snort.html).

Just like in Suricata, you need to specify in the configuration file which rule file Snort should use, for example:

```bash
ips =
{
    { variables = default_variables,
      include = '/home/htb-student/local.rules'
    }
}
```

Here, `include = '/home/htb-student/local.rules'` means "when Snort starts, load and use this rule file."

- **Use `-R`** followed by a file path if you want to load just **one specific** rules file.
- **Use `-rule-path`** followed by a folder path if you want to load **every** rules file inside that folder at once.

#### **Snort Outputs**

##### **#1. Basic Statistics**

When Snort finishes running, it outputs a summary report broken down into four key areas:

- **Packet Statistics:** Details on the raw network packets received and decoded (e.g., total packets, UDP vs. TCP).
- **Module Statistics:** Activity counters (peg counts) that track specific actions performed by Snort's internal modules (e.g., processed HTTP requests).
- **File Statistics:** A breakdown of analyzed files by type, size in bytes, and matching signatures.
- **Summary Statistics:** Overall performance metrics, including total runtime and processing speed (packets per second).

##### **#2. Alert Outputs**

To actually see detection events triggered by your rules, you must explicitly enable alerting using the `-A` flag. Snort supports multiple alert formats depending on your needs:

- **`-A cmg`**: Displays the alert alongside the raw packet headers and the actual payload (as seen in the command line examples provided).
- **`-A u2` (unified2)**: Logs events in a binary format intended for later analysis by other security tools.
- **`-A csv`**: Outputs alerts in a comma-separated format, which is highly customizable and easy to parse.

##### **#3. Performance Monitoring**

For deeper system tuning, Snort offers extra modules:

- **`perf_monitor`**: Captures real-time performance data without stopping Snort, which can be sent to external monitoring tools.
- **`profiler`**: Tracks how much time and memory specific rules and modules are consuming, helping you optimize Snort's performance.

### Snort Rule Development

#### **Snort Rule Development Example 1: Detecting Ursnif (Inefficiently)**

```bash
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Possible Ursnif C2 Activity"; flow:established,to_server; content:"/images/", depth 12; content:"_2F"; content:"_2B"; content:"User-Agent|3a 20|Mozilla/4.0 (compatible|3b| MSIE 8.0|3b| Windows NT"; content:!"Accept"; content:!"Cookie|3a|"; content:!"Referer|3a|"; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```

The Snort rule above is designed to detect certain variations of [Ursnif](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ursnif-variant-spreading-word-document) malware. The rule is inefficient since it misses HTTP sticky buffers.

#### **Snort Rule Development Example 3: Detecting Patchwork**

```jsx
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"OISF TROJAN Targeted AutoIt FileStealer/Downloader CnC Beacon"; flow:established,to_server; http_method; content:"POST"; http_uri; content:".php?profile="; http_client_body; content:"ddager=", depth 7; http_client_body; content:"&r1=", distance 0; http_header; content:!"Accept"; http_header; content:!"Referer|3a|"; sid:10000006; rev:1;)
```

The Snort rule above is designed to detect certain variations of malware used by the [Patchwork](https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2016/2016.07.07.UNVEILING_PATCHWORK/Unveiling-Patchwork.pdf) APT.

#### **Snort Rule Development Example 4: Detecting Patchwork (SSL)**

```jsx
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Patchwork SSL Cert Detected"; flow:established,from_server; content:"|55 04 03|"; content:"|08|toigetgf", distance 1, within 9; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:10000008; rev:1;)
```

The Snort rule above is designed to detect certain variations of malware used by the Patchwork APT

```bash
**$ sudo snort -c /root/snorty/etc/snort/snort.lua --daq-dir /usr/local/lib/daq -R /home/htb-student/local.rules -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/patchwork.pcap -A cmg**

## Zeek

### **Zeek Fundamentals**

Zeek is an open-source network analysis tool. It is also a tool for troubleshooting network issues and performing measurements. 'Zeek' sounds quite similar to 'Seek'. Initially, this software was named 'Bro'. Zeek uses a Scripting Language instead of the rules used by Suricata and Snort.

### **Zeek's Operation Modes**

Zeek operates in the following modes:

- Fully passive traffic analysis
- libpcap interface for packet capture
- Real-time and offline (e.g., PCAP-based) analysis
- Cluster support for large-scale deployments

### **Zeek's Architecture**

Zeek's architecture consists of two phases.

First, **the core (Event Engine)** is responsible for receiving all raw network data and translating it into objective event reports, merely recording what is happening on the network without making any judgments or evaluations.

These event reports are then automatically queued and forwarded to the second component, the **Script Interpreter**; here, the system automatically applies security rules pre-programmed by administrators (Zeek scripts) to deeply analyze the context, assess the threat level of each event, and make appropriate decisions to alert or block.

Most of Zeek's events are defined in `.bif` files located in the `/scripts/base/bif/plugins/` directory. [[Ref]](https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/scripts/base/bif/)

### **Zeek Logs**

Among the diverse array of logs Zeek produces, some familiar ones include:

- `conn.log`: This log provides details about IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP connections.
- `dns.log`: Here, you'll find the details of DNS queries and responses.
- `http.log`: This log captures the details of HTTP requests and responses.
- `ftp.log`: Details of FTP requests and responses are logged here.
- `smtp.log`: This log covers SMTP transactions, such as sender and recipient details.

[[ref]](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/logs/index.html)

Zeek, in its standard configuration, applies gzip compression to log files every hour. The older logs are then transferred into a directory named in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. When dealing with these compressed logs, alternative tools like `gzcat` for printing logs or `zgrep` for searching within logs can come in handy.

Zeek also provides a specialized tool known as `zeek-cut` for handling log files.

### Intrusion Detect ith Zeek

#### **Intrusion Detection With Zeek Example 1: Detecting Beaconing Malware**

Beaconing is a process by which malware communicates with its command and control (C2) server to receive instructions or exfiltrate data.

By analyzing connection logs (`conn.log`), we can look for patterns in outbound traffic.

```bash
$ /usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek -C -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/psempire.pcap
```

```bash
$ cat conn.log

If we look carefully enough we will notice connections being made to `51.15.197.127:80` approximately every 5 seconds, which is indicative of a malware beaconing.

The `psempire.pcap` file, which is located in the `/home/htb-student/pcaps` directory includes traffic related to PowerShell Empire. PowerShell Empire indeed beacons every 5 seconds in its default configuration.

#### **Intrusion Detection With Zeek Example 2: Detecting DNS Exfiltration**

Zeek is also useful when we suspect data exfiltration. Data exfiltration can be difficult to detect as it often mimics normal network traffic. However, with Zeek, we can analyze our network traffic at a deeper level.

Zeek's **files.log** can be used to identify large amounts of data being sent to an unusual external destination, or over non-standard ports, which may suggest data exfiltration. The http.log and dns.log can also be utilized to identify potential covert exfiltration channels, such as DNS tunneling or HTTP POST requests to a suspicious domain.

```bash
$ /usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek -C -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/dnsexfil.pcapng
```

```bash
$ cat dns.log

The output is a bit tricky to analyze. Let's narrow things down by using `zeek-cut`

```bash
$ cat conn.log | /usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h orig_bytes | sort | grep -v -e '^$' | grep -v '-' | datamash -g 1,2 sum 3 | sort -k 3 -rn | head -10

#### **Intrusion Detection With Zeek Example 4: Detecting PsExec**

**PsExec**, a part of the Sysinternals Suite, is frequently used for remote administration within Active Directory environments.

To illustrate a typical attack sequence, let's consider this: an attacker transfers the binary file `PSEXESVC.exe` to a target machine using the `ADMIN$` share, a special shared folder used in Windows networks, via the SMB protocol. Following this, the attacker remotely launches this file as a temporary service by utilizing the `IPC$` share, another special shared resource that enables *Inter-Process Communication*. 

We can identify SMB transfers and the typical use of `PsExec` using Zeek's `smb_files.log`, `dce_rpc.log`, and `smb_mapping.log`:

```bash
$ /usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek -C -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/psexec_add_user.pcap
```

```bash
$ cat smb_files.log
#separator \x09
#set_separator  ,
#empty_field    (empty)
#unset_field    -
#path   smb_files
