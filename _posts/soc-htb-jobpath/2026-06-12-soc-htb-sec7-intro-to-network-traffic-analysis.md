## **Introduction**

### **Network Traffic Analysis**

Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) play an active role in:

| Collecting | Real-time traffic within the network to analyze upcoming threats. |
| --- | --- |
| Setting | A baseline for day-to-day network communications. |
| Identifying | Analyzing traffic from non-standard ports, suspicious hosts, and issues with networking protocols such as HTTP errors, problems with TCP, or other networking misconfigurations. |
| Detecting | Malware on the wire, such as ransomware, exploits, and non standard interactions. |

→ NTA is also come in handy went investigating past incidents and during threat hunting

#### **Required Skills and Knowledge**

- TCP/IP Stack & OSI Model
- Basic Network Concepts
- Common Ports and Protocols
- Concepts of IP Packets and the Sublayers
- Protocol Transport Encapsulation
- Enviroment and Equipment

#### **Common Traffic Analysis Tools**

| **Tool / Technology** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **tcpdump** | A command-line utility that, with the aid of LibPcap, captures and interprets network traffic from a network interface or capture file. |
| **TShark** | A network packet analyzer much like TCPDump. It captures packets from a live network or reads and decodes from a file. It is the command-line variant of Wireshark. |
| **Wireshark** | A graphical network traffic analyzer. It captures and decodes frames off the wire, running many different dissectors to characterize protocols and applications for in-depth insight. |
| **NGrep** | A pattern-matching tool for network traffic packets (similar to grep for Linux). It reads live or PCAP traffic using regex expressions and BPF syntax. Excellent for debugging HTTP and FTP traffic. |
| **tcpick** | A command-line packet sniffer that specializes in tracking and reassembling TCP streams. It is excellent at reading a stream and reassembling it back into a file. |
| **Network Taps**<br>*(e.g., Gigamon, Niagra-taps)* | Devices capable of taking copies of network traffic (in-line or out-of-band) and sending them elsewhere for analysis. They can act actively, or passively by putting the original packet back on the wire unaltered. |
| **Networking Span Ports** | A way to copy frames from layer 2 or 3 networking devices during egress or ingress processing and send them to a collection point (often a mirrored port sending copies to a log server). |
| **Elastic Stack** | A culmination of tools that takes data from many sources, ingests it, and visualizes it to enable searching and analysis. |
| **SIEMs**<br>*(e.g., Splunk)* | A central point where data is analyzed and visualized. Common use cases include alerting, forensic analysis, and day-to-day checks against traffic. |

An many more…

#### BPF Syntax

All these tool above share the same syntax, that is **Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax**.

→ BPF is a technology that enables a raw interface to read and write from the Data-Link layer. 

**Filter primitives and logic**

- Layer 3-4 protocols: `ip`, `ip6`, `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`
- Layer 2-4 addresses:
`ether host`, `host`, `net`, `port`
    - Qualifiers: `src`, `dst`
- Logic: `and`, `or`, `not`, `()`
- Less common:
    - `vlan`, `portrange`, `gateway`,
    byte offsets:
    `ip[9:1] == 0x06`
- Example:
    - `ip and (tcp port 80 or udp port 53)`
    - `(ip and tcp port 80) or (ip and udp port 53)`

**Highly optimized - runs at the kernel level!**

#### **Performing Network Traffic Analysis**

##### #1 Ingest Traffic

On a huge system, once we have decided on our placement. begin capturing traffic. Utilize capture filters if we already have an idea of what we are looking for.

##### #2 Reduce Noise by Filtering

Once we complete the initial capture, an attempt to filter out unnecessary traffic from our view can make analysis easier. (Broadcast and Multicast traffic, for example.)

##### #3 **Analyze and Explore**

Look at specific hosts, protocols, even things as specific as flags set in the TCP header. The following questions will help us:

- Is the traffic encrypted or plain text? Should it be?
- Can we see users attempting to access resources to which they should not have access?
- Are different hosts talking to each other that typically do not?

##### #4 **Detect and Alert**

- Are we seeing any errors? Is a device not responding that should be?
- Use our analysis to decide if what we see is benign or potentially malicious.
- Other tools like IDS and IPS can come in handy at this point. They
can run heuristics and signatures against the traffic to determine if
anything within is potentially malicious.

##### #5 **Fix and Monitor**

This is not a part of the loop but, if we make a change or fix an issue, we should continue to monitor the source for a time to determine if the issue has been resolved.

### **Networking Primer - Layers 1-4**

#### **TCP Three-way Handshake**

The process happens in three steps:

1. **Client Request (SYN):** The client **initiates the conversation** by sending a packet with the `SYN` flag turned on. → This packet proposes an initial sequence number (used for tracking packets) and negotiates other communication settings, like window size.
2. **Server Response (SYN/ACK):** The server **receives the request and replies** with a packet that has both the `SYN` and `ACK` flags set. The `ACK` acknowledges the client's request, while the `SYN` establishes the server's own sequence numbers and any required changes to the connection options.
3. **Client Confirmation (ACK):** Finally, the client **sends back a packet** with the `ACK` flag set, confirming that it agrees to the server's terms.

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec7-intro-to-network-traffic-analysis/image%201.png)

In this packet capture, the `TCP` connection begins with a standard three-way handshake where the client sends a SYN request from a random high port to the server's HTTP port 80.

The server replies with a `SYN/ACK`, and the client confirms with an `ACK`. 

Once this session is successfully established, the client sends an HTTP request for an image `logo.png`, and as the data streams in, TCP continuously sends acknowledgments (`ACK`s) for each chunk of data to ensure reliable delivery.

#### **TCP Session Teardown**

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec7-intro-to-network-traffic-analysis/image%202.png)

In the image, we can see a set of packets similar to the three-way handshake. This is how TCP gracefully shuts connections. 

- Another flag we will see with TCP is the `FIN` flag. It is used for signaling that the data transfer is finished and the sender is requesting termination of the connection.
- The client acknowledges the receipt of the data and then sends a `FIN` and `ACK` to begin session termination.
- The server responds with an acknowledgment of the `FIN` and sends back its own `FIN`. Finally, the client acknowledges the session is complete and closes the connection.

→ Before session termination, we should see a packet pattern of:

1. `FIN, ACK`
2. `FIN, ACK`,
3. `ACK`

### **Networking Primer - Layers 5-7**

#### HTTP Methods

| **Method** | **Necessary** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HEAD` | **required** | `HEAD` is a safe method that requests a response from the server similar to a Get request except that the message body is not included. It is a great way to acquire more information about the server and its operational status. |
| `GET` | **required** | `GET` is the most common method used. It requests information and content from the server.<br>→ For example, `GET http://10.1.1.1/Webserver/index.html` requests the index.html page from the server based on our supplied URI. |
| `POST` | **optional** | `POST` is a way to submit information to a server based on the fields in the request. → For example, submitting a message to a Facebook post or website forum is a `POST` action.<br>  • The actual action taken can vary based on the server, and we should pay attention to the response codes sent back to validate the action. |
| `PUT` | **optional** | `PUT` will take the data appended to the message and place it under the requested URI.<br>  • If an item does not exist there already, it will create one with the supplied data.<br>  • If an object already exists, the new `PUT` will be considered the most up-to-date, and the object will be modified to match.<br>  • The easiest way to visualize the differences between `PUT` and `POST` is to think of it like this:<br>      ◦ `PUT` will create or update an object at the URI supplied<br>      ◦ `POST` will create child entities at the provided URI.<br>  • The action taken can be compared with the difference between creating a new file vs. writing comments about that file on the same page. |
| `DELETE` | **optional** | `DELETE` will remove the object at the given URI. |
| `TRACE` | **optional** | `TRACE` Allows for remote server diagnosis.<br>  • The remote server will *echo* the same request that was sent in its response if the `TRACE` method is enabled. |
| `OPTIONS` | **optional** | `OPTIONS` method can *gather information* on the *supported HTTP methods* the server recognizes.<br>  • This way, we can determine the requirements for interacting with a specific resource or server without actually requesting data or objects from it. |
| `CONNECT` | **optional** | `CONNECT` is reserved for use with Proxies or other security devices like firewalls. Connect allows for tunneling over HTTP. (`SSL tunnels`) |

For more information on HTTP as a protocol or how it operates, see [RFC:2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616).

#### HTTPS

HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses TLS/SSL encryption on ports 443 or 8443 to protect your entire web session from eavesdroppers. This ensures all communication between your browser and the server remains completely private and safe.

**TLS Handshake Via HTTPS**

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec7-intro-to-network-traffic-analysis/image%203.png)

**Blue Box**: TCP Session established

**Red Box**: TLS Handshake (Still using TCP)

Summarize the handshake:

1. Client and server exchange hello messages to agree on connection parameters.
2. Client and server exchange necessary cryptographic parameters to establish a premaster secret.
3. Client and server will exchange x.509 certificates and cryptographic information allowing for authentication within the session.
4. Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchanged random values.
5. Client and server issue negotiated security parameters to the record layer portion of the TLS protocol.
6. Client and server verify that their peer has calculated the same
security parameters and that the handshake occurred without tampering by an attacker.

For more information on how HTTPS functions and how TLS performs security operations, see [RFC:2246](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2246).

#### FTP

**File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** is an Application Layer protocol used for data transfer that is generally considered insecure and is largely being replaced by **SFTP**.

Uniquely, it requires two simultaneous TCP connections: 

- **port 21** for control commands
- **port 20** for actual data transfer.

FTP supports both standard user and **anonymous** authentication, and it operates in two main modes:

- **Active mode** is the default, where the client dictates the data port.
- **Passive mode** allows the server to assign the data port, enabling clients to successfully connect through firewalls or NAT restrictions.

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec7-intro-to-network-traffic-analysis/image%204.png)

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `USER` | specifies the user to log in as. |
| `PASS` | sends the password for the user attempting to log in. |
| `PORT` | when in active mode, this will change the data port used. |
| `PASV` | switches the connection to the server from active mode to passive. |
| `LIST` | displays a list of the files in the current directory. |
| `CWD` | will change the current working directory to one specified. |
| `PWD` | prints out the directory you are currently working in. |
| `SIZE` | will return the size of a file specified. |
| `RETR` | retrieves the file from the FTP server. |
| `QUIT` | ends the session. |

For more information on FTP, see [RFC:959](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc959).

#### SMB

SMB is a protocol used in Windows networks that allows computers to easily share resources with each other, like shared files, drives, and printers.

- It is connection-oriented and requires users authenticate to prove they have the right to access a specific resource.
- Older versions used UDP ports **137** and **138** while modern SMB runs directly over **TCP port 445**, TCP port **139**, or the **QUIC protocol**.
- Because modern SMB relies on TCP, it uses standard reliable communication methods, including the three-way handshake and packet acknowledgments.

→ SMB is the gateway to a company's files and resources, it is a very popular target for cyberattackers.

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec7-intro-to-network-traffic-analysis/image%205.png)

Here is a classic example of what an automated attack looks like on the wire.

**Orange Boxes:** Every interaction starts here. You can see the standard TCP synchronization process (`SYN`, `[SYN, ACK]`, `[ACK]`) happening multiple times. Each orange box represents a brand new attempt by the client to connect to the server.

**Blue Box:** This highlights the destination port being repeatedly targeted: **445**.

→ In typical network administration, this immediately tells you the traffic is trying to access Server Message Block (SMB) services, likely trying to get into shared folders or resources.

**Green Boxes:** This is the actual application layer conversation. The client tries to negotiate a session and authenticate (specifically trying to use the account `DESKTOP-2AEFM7G\user`). Look at the lines at the bottom of each green box: `Error: STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`. The server is flatly denying them access.

This is just one example of SMB use. Another common thing we will see is file-share access between servers and hosts. For the most part, this is regular communication. However, if we see a host access file shares on other hosts, this is not common. We have to pay attention to who is requesting connections, where to, and what they are doing.

## **Analysis**

### **The Analysis Process**

NTA is about breaking down network data to figure out what is normal and catching what isn't. It gives defenders the visibility needed to set a **baseline** for everyday traffic, making it much easier to spot anomalies.

*Collecting a baseline* means recording what normal, everyday network traffic looks like so you can easily spot unusual or malicious activity when it happens.

#### **Analysis Dependencies**

Traffic capturing and analysis can be performed in two different ways.

- **Passive:** we are just copying data that we can see without directly interacting with the packets.
- **Active (Inline traffic captures):** requires us to take a more hands-on approach.

We can perform the capture and analysis once done, or we can perform analysis in real-time while the traffic is live.

| **Dependencies** | **Passive** | **Active** | **Description (Key Takeaways)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Permission** | ✔️ | ✔️ | * **Always get written authorization.**<br>* Capturing data without it can violate company policy or laws (especially in banking or healthcare).<br>* Stay ethical and legal. |
| **Mirrored Port** | ✔️ | ❌ | * **Requires a switch/router configured to copy data** to your specific interface.<br>* Your Network Interface Card (NIC) must be in promiscuous mode.<br>* Necessary to see traffic outside your immediate broadcast domain (VLANs).<br>* *Wireless note:* You must be connected to the target SSID to capture its traffic. |
| **Capture Tool** | ✔️ | ✔️ | * **Requires software** like Wireshark, TCPDump, or Netminer to ingest traffic.<br>* PCAP files grow massively and quickly.<br>* Applying filters forces the app to parse data repeatedly, requiring a host computer with **abundant resources**. |
| **In-line Placement** | ❌ | ✔️ | * **Requires a network topology change.**<br>* You must place a Tap directly in the flow of traffic.<br>* It acts as an invisible "next hop"—source and destination hosts will not notice it. |
| **Network Tap or Host With Multiple NICs** | ❌ | ✔️ | * **Requires a device with two NICs** or a dedicated Network Tap.<br>* Acts like an extra router in the middle of a link, duplicating data directly from the source.<br>* **Best placement:** A Layer 3 link between switched segments to capture all traffic routing outside the local network. |
| **Storage and Processing Power** | ✔️ | ✔️ | * **Active capture** (Layer 3 routed link) is high-pressure and high-volume (like "a water hose filling a teacup"). Requires massive storage and CPU.<br>* **Passive capture** (inside a LAN) is a steady, more manageable stream (like "water from a fountain"). |

Without a **baseline**, analyzing a packet capture is incredibly tedious because you have to manually verify every single connection to see if it belongs there. A baseline lets you immediately strip away all the "known-good" communications.

Once the normal traffic is filtered out, outliers stand out immediately. For example, if you know standard user PCs shouldn't be talking directly to each other over web or file-sharing ports, spotting that activity becomes an instant red flag rather than a needle in a haystack.

In a security breach or network failure, time is your biggest enemy. A baseline gives you the rapid visibility needed to spot the bad acting, escalate the issue, and start remediation before major damage occurs.

### **Analysis in Practice**

Analysis can be distilled down to a few basic tenets

#### **Descriptive Analysis**

**Descriptive analysis** is to describe a data set *based on individual characteristics*. It helps to detect possible errors in data collection and/or outliers in the data set.

- `What is the issue?`
    - Suspected breach? Networking issue?
- `Define our scope and the goal. (what are we looking for? which time period?)`
    - Target: multiple hosts potentially downloading a malicious file from *bad.example.com*
    - When: within the last *48 hours + 2 hours* from now.
    - Supporting info: filenames/types '*superbad.exe*' '*new-crypto-miner.exe*'
- `Define our target(s) (net / host(s) / protocol)`
    - Scope: *192.168.100.0/24* network, protocols used were **HTTP** and **FTP**.

→ Using this workflow, we will determine our issue, what we are looking for, when, and where to find it. 

#### **Diagnostic Analysis**

Diagnostic analysis clarifies the **causes**, **effects**, and **interactions of conditions**. It provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation. 

→ It like trying to figure out why is happened and how it happened.

#### **Predictive Analysis**

**Predictive analysis** creates a *predictive model for future probabilities*. this method use to identify **trends**, **detect deviations from expected values** at an early stage, and **predict future occurrences** as accurately as possible.

→ Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic analyses.

#### **Prescriptive Analysis**

The final step of analyzing traffic is figuring out **what actions to take** to fix the current problem and stop it from happening again. Once the fire is out, you document "lessons learned" to improve your defensive posture and processes for the next time.

- **Define the Problem:** Are you dealing with a broken network connection, or are you hunting down a suspected breach?
- **Set the Scope:** What exactly are you looking for, and in what timeframe? *(e.g., searching for malicious file downloads over the last 48 hours).*
- **Identify Targets:** Pinpoint the specific network segment (like a `/24` subnet), the specific hosts, and the protocols (like HTTP or FTP) involved.
- **Capture the Traffic:** Pull live data from the affected network link or grab historical PCAP files from your security tools.
- **Filter Out the Noise:** Strip away the normal, known-good baseline traffic so you are only looking at data relevant to your scope.
- **Analyze What is Left:** Dig into the filtered packets. Look for specific indicators, like `GET` requests for a bad file, or reconstruct data transfers to see exactly what happened.
- **Take Detailed Notes:** Document your process, timeframes, suspicious IPs, and specific packet numbers. Good documentation is critical.
- **Summarize Your Findings:** Create a clear, concise report so decision-makers can take fast action (like quarantining infected hosts).

→ The Process is a Loop

#### **Key Components of an Effective Analysis**

##### **1. Know your environment**

You must understand what your baseline looks like. Maintaining updated asset inventories and network maps is essential so you can easily differentiate between legitimate hosts and rogue devices.

##### **2. Placement is Key**

Position your capture tools as close to the source of the problem as possible. For external threats, monitor your inbound internet links; for isolated internal issues, place your tools on the specific network segment of the affected host.

##### **3. Persistence**

Threats are not always noisy or constant. Malicious activities, like an attacker's Command and Control (C2) server pinging a compromised machine, might only happen once a day. You must be patient and keep digging to catch stealthy anomalies before they escalate into a full-scale breach.

#### **Analysis Approach**

- **Start with the basics:** Attackers usually come from the internet, so *check common traffic first* (like web browsing and emails). Then, check *remote connection tools* (like SSH or RDP) to make sure they aren't breaking your company's security rules.
- **Look for repeating patterns:** *If a computer reaches out to the internet at the exact same time every day*, it might be malware automatically checking in with a hacker's server.
- **Watch for computers talking directly to each other:** Normal employee computers *should only talk to servers, routers, or printers*. If two regular employee computers are talking directly to each other, it is highly suspicious.
- **Notice weird, one-off events:** Pay attention if a computer *suddenly changes its daily habits*, shows *strange software details*, or *opens random, unusual network ports*.
- **Ask for a second opinion:** Staring at lines of data for too long can make you blind to clues. *Ask a teammate to look at the data with you* to catch things you might have missed.
- **Use all your tools:** Don't just rely on basic packet-capture software. *Use your firewalls, automated alerts*, and *other security tools* to get the full picture and keep your network safe.

## **Tcpdump**

### **Tcpdump Fundamentals**

Tcpdump is a command=line packet sniffer and it had a Windows twin called WinDump (but it depreccated so we could install a WSL to run **Tcpdump**). To capture network traffic from "off the wire," it uses the libraries `pcap` and `libpcap`, paired with an interface in promiscuous mode to listen for data.

→ This allows the program to see and capture packets *sourcing from* or *destined for* any device in the local area network, not just the packets destined for us.

Due to the direct access to the hardware, we need the `root` or the `administrator's` privileges to run this tool.

`TCPDump` often comes preinstalled on the majority of Linux operating systems.

Often it can be found in `/usr/sbin/tcpdump`.

```bash
sudo tcpdump
```

#### **Traffic Captures with Tcpdump**

##### **Basic Capture Options**

| **Switch Command** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| D | Will display any interfaces available to capture from. |
| i | Selects an interface to capture from. ex. `-i eth0` |
| n, nn | Do not convert addresses (example host addresses and port numbers like `8.8.8.8` to [`google.com`](https://google.com)) to names. |
| e | Will grab the ethernet header along with upper-layer data. |
| X | Show Contents of packets in hex and ASCII. |
| XX | Same as `X`, but will also specify ethernet headers. (like using Xe) |
| v, vv, vvv | Increase the verbosity of output shown and saved. |
| c | Grab a specific number of packets, then quit the program. |
| s | Defines how much of a packet to grab. |
| S | change relative sequence numbers in the capture display to absolute sequence numbers. (13248765839 to 101) |
| q | Print less protocol information. |
| r <file.pcap> | Read from a file. |
| w <file.pcap> | Write into a file |
| l | Pipe the contents of a pcap file out to another function such as 'grep’ |

To see the complete list of switches, we can utilize the `man` pages.

##### **Listing Available Interfaces**

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -D

1.eth0 [Up, Running, Connected]
2.any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces) [Up, Running]
3.lo [Up, Running, Loopback]
4.bluetooth0 (Bluetooth adapter number 0) [Wireless, Association status unknown]
5.bluetooth-monitor (Bluetooth Linux Monitor) [Wireless]
6.nflog (Linux netfilter log (NFLOG) interface) [none]
7.nfqueue (Linux netfilter queue (NFQUEUE) interface) [none]
8.dbus-system (D-Bus system bus) [none]
9.dbus-session (D-Bus session bus) [none]
```

##### **Choosing an Interface to Capture From**

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0

#### **Tcpdump Output**

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec7-intro-to-network-traffic-analysis/image%206.png)

| **Filter** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| Timestamp | `Yellow` The timestamp field comes first and is configurable to show the time and date in a format we can ingest easily. |
| Protocol | `Orange` This section will tell us what the upper-layer header is. In our example, it shows IP. |
| Source & Destination IP.Port | `Orange` This will show us the source and destination of the packet along with the port number used to connect. |
| Flags | `Green`  This portion shows any flags utilized. (P here means PUT) |
| Sequence and Acknowledgement Numbers | `Red`  This section shows the sequence and acknowledgment<br> numbers used to track the TCP segment. Our example is utilizing low numbers to assume that relative sequence and ack numbers are being displayed. |
| Protocol Options | `Blue`  Here, we will see any negotiated TCP values established between the client and server, such as window size, selective acknowledgments, window scale factors, and more. |
| Notes / Next Header | `White`  Misc notes the dissector found will be present<br>here. As the traffic we are looking at is encapsulated, we may see more header information for different protocols. In our example, we can see the TCPDump dissector recognizes FTP traffic within the encapsulation to display it for us. |

#### **File Input/Output with Tcpdump**

Using `-w` will write our capture to a file.

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w ~/output.pcap

tcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes
10 packets captured
131 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
```

This capture above will generate the output to a file called `output.pcap`.

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -r ~/output.pcap

This will read the capture stored in `output.pcap`.

### **Tcpdump Packet Filtering**

| **Filter** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| host | `host` will filter visible traffic to show anything involving the designated host. Bi-directional |
| src / dest | `src` and `dest` are modifiers. We can use them to designate a source or destination host or port. |
| net | `net` will show us any traffic sourcing from or destined to the network designated. It uses / notation. |
| proto | will filter for a specific protocol type. (ether, TCP, UDP, and ICMP as examples) |
| port | `port` is bi-directional. It will show any traffic with the specified port as the source or destination. |
| portrange | `portrange` allows us to specify a range of ports. (0-1024) |
| less / greater "< >" | `less` and `greater` can be used to look for a packet or protocol option of a specific size. |
| and / && | `and` `&&` can be used to concatenate two different filters together. for example, src host AND port. |
| or | `or` allows for a match on either of two conditions. It does not have to meet both. It can be tricky. |
| not | `not` is a modifier saying anything but x. For example,  not UDP. |

With these filters, we can filter the network traffic on most properties to facilitate the analysis

#### **Pre-Capture Filters VS. Post-Capture Processing**

When utilizing filters, we can apply them directly to the capture or apply them when reading a capture file. By applying them to the capture, it will drop any traffic not matching the filter. This will reduce the amount of data in the captures and potentially clear out traffic we may need later, so use them only when looking for something specific, such as troubleshooting a network connectivity issue.

#### **Interpreting Tips and Tricks**

- Using the `-S` switch will display absolute sequence numbers
- The `-v`, `-X`, and `-e` switches can help you increase the amount of data captured
- the `-c`, `-n`, `-s`, `-S`, and `-q` switches can help reduce and modify the amount of data written and seen.

#### **Piping a Capture to Grep**

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -Ar http.cap -l | grep 'mailto:*'

reading from file http.cap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 65535
  <a href="mailto:ethereal-web[AT]ethereal.com">ethereal-web[AT]ethereal.com</a>
  <a href="mailto:free-support[AT]thewrittenword.com">free-support[AT]thewrittenword.com</a>
  <a href="mailto:ethereal-users[AT]ethereal.com">ethereal-users[AT]ethereal.com</a>
  <a href="mailto:ethereal-web[AT]ethereal.com">ethereal-web[AT]ethereal.com</a>
```

Using `-l` in this way allowed us to examine the capture quickly and grep for keywords or formatting we suspected could be there. In this case, we used the `-l` to pass the output to `grep` and looking for any instance of the phrase `mailto:*` 

#### **Looking for TCP Protocol Flags**

```bash
$ tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp[13] &2 != 0'
```

This is counting to the 13th byte in the structure and looking at the 2nd bit. If it is set to 1 or ON, the SYN flag is set.

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp[13] &2 != 0'

##### Analyze Tab

![image.png](/assets/img/cdsa/sec7-intro-to-network-traffic-analysis/image%2012.png)

This menu is all about manipulating how you view, filter, and interpret the specific packets right in front of you. It contains tools to help you isolate specific conversations, fix Wireshark if it is reading a protocol incorrectly, and stitch fragmented packets back together.

The **Top 3 Most Important Tools** in this menu that you will use constantly:

1. **Follow (TCP/UDP/HTTP Stream):** This is arguably the best feature in Wireshark. If you select a packet and use this, Wireshark will strip away all the complicated network headers and reassemble the entire conversation into a single, readable text window. It lets you read a web page request or a downloaded file exactly as the user saw it.
2. **Decode As...:** Sometimes Wireshark gets confused. For example, if a company hides their web traffic by putting it on port `9999` instead of `80`, Wireshark won't know it is HTTP. "Decode As" lets you force Wireshark to read that traffic correctly.
3. **Expert Information:** This is Wireshark's built-in warning system. It groups all the errors, dropped packets, warnings, and malformed data it found into one easy-to-read list.

| **Tool Name** | **Category** | **Description** | **Best Used For** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Display Filters...** | Filter Management | Opens a window to manage, edit, and save your favorite display filters. | Keeping your most-used filters handy so you don't have to retype them. |
| **Display Filter Macros...** | Filter Management | Allows you to create variables/shortcuts for complex filters. | Advanced filtering setups for large, repetitive investigations. |
| **Display Filter Expression...** | Filter Management | Opens a graphical menu that lists every possible protocol and field to help you build a filter. | Figuring out the correct syntax for a filter when you can't remember the exact command. |
| **Apply as Column** | Context Action | Takes whatever specific data field you have clicked on and makes it a permanent column at the top of your screen. | Customizing your view (e.g., making a column just for HTTP hostnames). |
| **Apply as Filter** | Context Action | Instantly applies a filter based on the exact data field you currently have selected. | Quickly isolating traffic without typing. *(Usually accessed by right-clicking a packet).* |
| **Prepare as Filter** | Context Action | Generates the filter text in the search bar based on your selection, but waits for you to press Enter. | Building a complex filter piece-by-piece before executing it. |
| **Conversation Filter** | Context Action | Instantly filters the view to only show traffic between the Source and Destination of the selected packet. | Focusing exclusively on the communication between two specific machines. |
| **Enabled Protocols...** | Protocol Interpretation | A massive list of every protocol Wireshark knows, allowing you to turn them on or off. | Disabling a protocol if Wireshark is misidentifying traffic and making your screen messy. |
| **Decode As...** | Protocol Interpretation | Forces Wireshark to interpret a specific port or data stream as a specific protocol. | Fixing Wireshark when it doesn't recognize non-standard ports (e.g., forcing port 2222 to read as SSH). |
| **Reload Lua Plugins** | Protocol Interpretation | Reloads custom scripts (written in Lua) without having to restart Wireshark entirely. | Used by developers writing custom packet dissectors. |
| **SCTP** | Deep Dive | Tools specifically for analyzing Stream Control Transmission Protocol traffic. | Troubleshooting telecommunications or specialized signaling networks. |
| **Follow** | Deep Dive | Reassembles a scattered stream of packets into a single, clean text or raw data window. | Reading the actual payload (like reading the raw HTML of a webpage or the text of an FTP login). |
| **Show Packet Bytes...** | Deep Dive | Opens a separate window to view the raw hexadecimal and ASCII bytes of a selected packet. | Inspecting the absolute raw data of a packet for hidden malware or anomalies. |
| **Expert Information** | Deep Dive | A log of all anomalies, warnings, errors, and noteworthy events Wireshark automatically detected. | Quickly finding where the network is broken (e.g., finding packets that were dropped or rejected). |
